My scholarship focuses on understanding and facilitating engineering education reform, through which I seek to educate engineers who can demonstrate leadership, responsibility, and innovation. Inspired by sociology, ethics, history, and educational research, I teach and conduct interdisciplinary research in `engineering ethics`, `international engineering education`, and `engineering cultures`. I have been honored as a major contributor to the US National Academy of Engineering `Exemplars in Engineering Ethics Education` and as the `KEEN Rising Star` at The Ohio State University. My research is published with journals like the Journal of Engineering Education, Science and Engineering Ethicsï¼ŒEngineering Studies, International Journal of Engineering Education.
