STEM education emerged at the turn of the century, integrating knowledge from science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and other related fields. It is a collection of educational concepts aimed at cultivating students' awareness of problems, interdisciplinary thinking, and scientific literacy. This course combines theoretical learning and practical exploration, helping students grasp relevant concepts in science and technology education. Drawing on STEM education principles, it encourages students to experience, analyze, and reflect on the practice of science and technology education. This course is a required elective for the undergraduate education minor at Tsinghua University and is co-offered by faculty from the Institute of Education and the Basic Industrial Training Center.
